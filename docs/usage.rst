Using BioCompass in your queried genome
####

The current version of BioCompass can network the gene cluster from ONE strain/genome against the gene cluster at `NCBI/GenBank <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/>`_ and `MIBiG databases <http://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org>`_. Future Implementations will provide the option to analyze multiple strains.

We currently working on it. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Updates will be available by 10/31/2016.
